  department: "Computer Science",
  abstract:
    "Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power, with profound implications for cryptography. This paper delves into the transformative applications of quantum algorithms in securing digital communications and data integrity. We begin by examining Shor's algorithm, which threatens traditional public-key cryptosystems like RSA by factoring large numbers exponentially faster than classical computers. Building on this, the discussion extends to Grover's algorithm and its impact on symmetric encryption, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives such as lattice-based and multivariate cryptography. The abstract explores post-quantum cryptography standards proposed by NIST, including key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signatures designed to withstand quantum attacks. Furthermore, we analyze the integration of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, leveraging quantum entanglement for unconditionally secure key exchange. Real-world case studies, including quantum-safe blockchain implementations and secure multi-party computation, illustrate practical deployments. Challenges such as quantum decoherence, error correction, and scalability are addressed, alongside emerging hybrid classical-quantum systems. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the urgency for cryptographic evolution in an era of quantum supremacy. This comprehensive review serves as a guide for researchers and practitioners navigating the quantum cryptographic landscape, highlighting both vulnerabilities and innovations in safeguarding information against quantum threats.",
