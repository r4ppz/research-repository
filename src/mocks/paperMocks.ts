    authorName: "Dr. Jane Doe",
    abstractText:
      "This humorous yet methodologically grounded study explores quantum entanglement through analogies in feline behavioral unpredictability. A simulated two-state model is introduced to represent observation-induced behavioral collapse. While the work draws from Schrödinger's Cat thought experiment, it extends the analogy to cognitive uncertainty in animal perception, illustrating how measurement and environment interactions produce non-deterministic responses.",
